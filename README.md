This project categorizes excerpts taken from three different authors using the kaggle dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identificationusing handcrafted features and 

We experimented with multiple neural network architectures such as Multi-Layer perceptron (MLP), Recursive Neural Network (RNN) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this classification task.
